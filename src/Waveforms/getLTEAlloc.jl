---  
Returns the vector of allocated subcarriers associated to Long Term evolution frequency mapping.
In LTE, depending on FFT size, only few subcarriers are allocated (45-55%). This function takes a FFT size as input 
and returns an array of size nbSubcarriers

- nFFT	  : Desired FFT size (128, 256, 512, 1024, 1536, 2048, 4096) [Int]
# --- Output parameters 
- allocatedSubcarrier : Vector of subcarriers index [Array{Int}]
